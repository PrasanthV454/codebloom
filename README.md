# 🌸 Codebloom

**Codebloom** is an open-source tool that **blooms your codebase into an interactive topological map** — revealing the structure, components, and interdependencies of your software system from the inside out.

Whether you're onboarding onto a large monolith, refactoring microservices, or reviewing architectural decisions, Codebloom helps you **see, explore, and understand** your system at every level.

## 🧠 What It Does

- 🌳 **Parses code repositories** to extract physical components (functions, classes)
- 🧩 **Groups components into logical layers** (API, service, DB, external)
- 🔀 **Builds directional dependency maps** across components
- 🌐 **Creates a hierarchical topological map** from high-level modules to low-level methods
- 🖼️ **Visualizes the map in an interactive UI**, powered by Excalidraw + Mermaid
